You've managed to get oauth to work for Yelp, which is probably one of the hardest tasks you've encountered so far. Congratulations! The hope is that you are now able to apply this skill to utilize the hundreds, if not thousands, of useful web APIs out there to do interesting things.

In this hackathon, your objective is to build a web front-end to interact with a web API of your choice.

# Github

None provided. The team leader should start one from scratch and each team member can fork from it.

# API

Pick an API about something you feel passionate about.

# Requirements

* The front-end should utilize FOUR different API methods

# Q/A

## Logistics

* __Who works on what?__ The work must be fairly distributed among the team members. One possible way to distribute work is for each team member to be responsible for an API method. If your team's size is larger than four, two can work on a single, harder API method together, or one can work on getting oauth to work for the team.
* __Should the site go live?__ Yes. Please host it somewhere so that your team can demo.

# Time

2.5 hours

# Team

Work together with the same team from the previous week. 

# Submission

Since there's no skeleton repository you can fork from, the submission will not be based on the two-level fork-pull requests. Instead, you will make your submission by creating a post to [this issue](https://github.com/ucdd2-sp15/announcements/issues/19).

# Milestones

* Have build an interface for 4 API methods (10 points x 4)
* Have performed a demo of the site to a team staff or another team (10 points)

# Demo

For the last 15 minutes of the class, each team will present to either another team or a teaching staff.
