Today, we will have two activities related for your class projects. 

* Peer project proposal presentation and feedback
* Working on the project

# Peer Feedback

Deliverables:
* Write down the first two or three questions the other team asked. Put these into README.md under a new section called Q/As.
* Help the other team identify at least three must-have features. These features must be entered as issues.
* Help the other team figure out what would be a good demo to show.
* Milestones must be specified as issues (some teams only had them in README.md).
