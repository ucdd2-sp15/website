title: Week
lead: JQuery + Public APIs
template: challenge.jade
---

Your learning challenge this week is to do two mini projects using [jquery](https://www.jquery.com/). 

For the team learning component, the mini project is modify the yelp-jquery site your team has worked on in the previous week to use the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation).

For the individual learning component, the mini project is to build a new site. Take any public API and build a site for interacting with the API, simialr to the one you've built for the sunlight hackathon. But you need to work on this site individually. This is to make sure you have indeed obtained the skill to independently build something awesome. 


# Team Learning (50 points)

## Objectives

Get your team's yelp-jquery site to use the Yelp API 

## Due

11:59pm, Friday

## Teaming

Same as the previous week

## Time and Location

Each team decides on a time and location to meet before the submission deadline.

## Milestones

- figure out how [authentication](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/authentication) works (10 points)
- get the [Search API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api) to work for the site (20 points)
- get the [Business API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/business) to work for the site (20 points)

## Submission

The team leader will again take individual teams' pull requests, merge them, and make a single pull request to the original repository, which is [ucdd2-sp15/yelp-jquery](https://github.com/ucdd2-sp15/yelp-jquery).

# Individual Learning (50 points)

Create a JQuery-based web app for a public API of your choice

## API

Choose any API you like to use, as long as it's one that's not already used in a previous hakcathon or learning challenge. Ideally, you should choose one relevant to something you care about. If you reall have a hard time choosing a public API, discuss with your classmates for ideas.

## Github Repository

For the first time, there's no skeleton code available. You need to create your own github repository from scratch. Hope by now you are ready to ride without any training wheel!

## Milestones

* Have figured out how authentication works for the API of your choice (10 points)
* Have developed one `listing` feature using the API (10 points)
* Have developed one `showing details` feature using the API (10 points)
* Have developed another `listing` feature using the API (10 points)
* Have developed another `showing details` feature using the API (10 points)

## Due
