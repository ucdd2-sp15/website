* Have completed the [introductory hackathon](../../hackathon/class-website)

# Github Repositories

<code>ucdd-lodash</code>

<code>html-gen</code>

<a href="https://github.com/ucdd2-sp15/ucdd-htmlgen" class="btn btn-info">https://github.com/ucdd2-sp15/ucdd-htmlgen</a>

# Team Learning (50 points)

## Milestones

1. Have each team member implemented ONE function in <code>lib/ucdd-lodash.js</code> (40 points)
2. Have made a single pull request to the class's repository (10 points). 

## Due
11:59pm, Friday

## Submission
The team member's contribution should come to the team's fork in the form of pull requests. The team leader's own contribution is made directly to the team's fork. After mering all the pull requests from other team members, the team leader should make a single pull request to the class's repository. The pull request message should list the names of the team members and also the points the team has earned.

## Absence
People who fail to show up and participate in a team learning session will not earn any point from this part.

# Individual Learning (50 points)

## Milestones
1. Have implemented N functions in <code>lib.js</code> (10 x N points = ? points, Max: 40 points).
2. Have committed and pushed my implementation to my own fork (10 points). The final commit message should report the number of points earned.

## Due
11:59pm, Sunday

## Submission

You do not need to make a pull request from your fork of <code>html-gen</code>. You just need to make sure you commit your code and push this commit to your own Github fork. We will assume your most recent commit prior to the deadline is your submission.

# Grading

We will use a honor system in which you will self-report the points you believe you have earned. For the team learning part, the team leader reports the points earned in the pull request message. For the individual learning part, you report the points you've earned in the last commit message prior to the deadline.

Each week, the grader for this class will take a random sample of the submissions to check for consistency to ensure fairness and promote honesty.
