# Posting
Your grades will be posted on the website and updated periodically. You can monitor your progress so far, make sure all your efforts are correctly graded, and have an idea how well you perform in relation to your classmates. Only the last four digits of your student ID will be visible to the public.

# Correction

* __What?__ If you believe there is a mistake in a quantitative assessment (e.g., you have submitted two but only one was scored), you can request for a correction.
* __When?__ Within one week of receiving your grade. After one week, no correction request will be accepted.
* __How?__ You must email the teaching staff an explanation of the mistake. 

# Regrading

* __What?__ If you believe you have been unfairly graded on a qualitative assessment (e.g., how well something is written? how well something is presented? how good is your solution?, it is possible for you to formally request regrading.
* __When?__ Within 48 hours of receiving your grade. After 48 hours, no regrading request on qualitative value assignment/questions will be accepted.
* __How?__ You must write a rebuttal and email it to the teaching staff. The rebuttal must be grammatically correct, spell checked, and fewer than 250 words. In the rebuttal, you should explain how your assignment/question was incorrectly graded and how your answer is correct. Simply saying, “I believe I deserve a B because my question is good enough” or “I need a B to be a doctor” will not be accepted.
