---

By default, the hackathon is held each Monday from 4pm to 6:30pm. The location is the 2nd floor lounge in the ATLAS building. However, we are plannign to bring several hackathons to off-site locations throughout the semester. It could be in another hacker space on campus, off campus, or at a local company who is sponsoring a hackathon event. It could even be heald outside on a nice day. Please pay attention to the course annoucement and check the web page for the specific hackathon.
