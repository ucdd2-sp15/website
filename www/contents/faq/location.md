title: Where is this week's hackathon?
template: index.jade
---

The default location is in the 2nd floor lounge in the ATLAS building. However, we hold several off-site hackathons throughout the semester. It could be in another hacker space on campus, off campus, or at a local company who is sponsoring a hackathon event. It could also be heald outside on a nice day. Please pay attention to the course annoucement and check the web page for the specific hackathon.
