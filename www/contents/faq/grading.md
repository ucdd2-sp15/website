Each time you have accomplished a deliverable for a learning challenege or a in-class hackathon, you earn a certain number of points. Over the semester, you will be racking up points. At the end of the semester, your total point will be mapped to a letter grade. More information about grading can be found on [this page](/syllabus/grading.html).
